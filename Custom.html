<!--USE MONTREAL GEOJSON from last april (see zachmaps repository on github)
Tutorials followed include...
Adding GEOJSON - https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-geojson/
Multiple Popup elements - https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/popup-multipleelements/

SOURCE: it must be stressed that the images in this map are not mine. They are originally from the renown Notman Collection, 
scannned and made into a book by Bryan Demchinsky called Montreal Then and Now.
images in this map are scanned copies of these original images, and the text descriptions as well come from Bryan Demchinsky. The 2021 images are my own as well as the added on information. I also was the creator of the original GEOJSON back in APril 2021 -->
